Arithmetic operations can be performed in bash scripts using the expr command or 
using double parentheses ((...)).
Here is an example of using the expr command to perform arithmetic operations:

#!/bin/bash
# Take input from the user
read -p "Enter two numbers: " num1 num2

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum=`expr $num1 + $num2`
diff=`expr $num1 - $num2`
product=`expr $num1 \* $num2`
quotient=`expr $num1 / $num2`
remainder=`expr $num1 % $num2`

# Display the results
echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $diff"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
echo "Remainder: $remainder"

Here is an example of using double parentheses to perform arithmetic operations:
#!/bin/bash

# Take input from the user
read -p "Enter two numbers: " num1 num2

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum=$((num1 + num2))
diff=$((num1 - num2))
product=$((num1 * num2))
quotient=$((num1 / num2))
remainder=$((num1 % num2))

# Display the results
echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $diff"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
echo "Remainder: $remainder"
